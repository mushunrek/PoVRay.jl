[![Build Status](https://github.com/mushunrek/PoVRay.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/mushunrek/PoVRay.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This Julia package provides a wrapper for the PoV-Ray engine. It is based on ideas from [JuliRay](https://github.com/hyrodium/JuliRay). In order to use it, please make sure that you have PoV-Ray installed, for details see their [official webpage](http://www.povray.org/). 

# Contributing
The project has come to life in the context of [this paper](https://lab.wias-berlin.de/zass/dynamics-of-spheres), see also [this package](https://github.com/mushunrek/Colloids.jl). As such it currently only offers the few options that were required there. If the structure of the wrapper suits your needs, consider contributing by extending the options.
